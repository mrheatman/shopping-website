    The finish of your paint, or sheen, will have a major impact on your walls. 
    Gloss, satin, egg shell â€“ with these options comes many considerations.
     High-traffic areas do well with gloss or satin as they hold up better 
     to touching and can be cleaned more easily. But, they can make wall 
     imperfections (wavy drywall, patched areas) much more pronounced. 
     A more matte-like finish, such as flat, will not clean as well or 
     endure touches as well, but you won't see imperfections as much.
