     <li><h2>About Welding: </h2>When you start learning to weld, it’s easy to
         be overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information available on the
          subject. It can be difficult to begin your welding journey without
           knowing about the different welding types that exist. Some are easier
            to learn, while others are quite difficult.

        While certain types of welding produce clean beads that are visually
         appealing and require little to no cleanup, other types produce the
          exact opposite. What type of metal do you plan on welding? It makes a
           difference. To help simplify the subject, we’ve compiled important
            information regarding nine different types of welding processes.

    Not all welders are created equally. Welding is a growing in-demand 
     that can be a career for you. But welding is also a skill that you can use

      it to improve your current job, especially in the agriculture or auto
       industries. Welding has limitless possibilities depending on the kind of
        welding you are looking to learn.

There are four main types of welding. MIG – Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW),
 TIG – Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW), Stick – Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW) 
 and Flux-cored – Flux-cored Arc Welding (FCAW). We dive deeper into each type 
 of welding here.
