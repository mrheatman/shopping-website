     <li><h2>About Carpenter: </h2> specializing in electrical Professionals who are
         skilled in carpentry are worth their weight in… wood! Without these
          tradespeople, the houses we live in, the furniture we sit on, and the 
          structures in which we work and play would not exist. Most laypeople think
          of carpentry as one field, but like medicine, law, education, welding,
           building, etc., there are various specialties. Let’s look at different
            types of carpenters so you can zero in on finding the right carpenter to
             meet your needs. .</li>

     <br>
     <li><h2>Type Of Carpenter:</h2>1.Rough: Here, the carpenter focuses on the
         “rough” framing of a building - that is, the walls, rafters, floors, posts, 
         beams, and roof. They essentially create the structure’s “skeleton,” while
          ensuring their work meets project specifications, building codes, and 
          strength standards.

        2.Finish: With finish work, the carpenter focuses on flooring,
         staircases, moldings, trims, etc. Unlike framing, this work will be visible
         from the outside, so it must be neat, clean, and finely detailed.

         There are also several “subcategories” in which different types of
          carpenters work, including:

          Trim: Trim carpenters install and repair trim and molding found on
           doors, windows, baseboards, mantels, etc. It is precise work, and as 
           a type of finish carpentry, elements need to be neat and clean.
           
Cabinetmaking: Another type of finish carpentry, cabinetry is intricate work and
 is in great demand for high-end builds and remodels.

 Green Carpentry: Here, carpenters specialize in using environmentally-friendly
  materials and practices.

  Residential: These carpenters typically focus on new home builds and/or 
  remodels.

  Commercial: These professionals work on office buildings, malls, retail stores,
   restaurants, and other commercial buildings.
   
   Industrial: In this highly specialized field, carpenters work on dams,
    tunnel bracing, and sewer projects
